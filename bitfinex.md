Since some time ago {% aff Bitfinex https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC %} plots charts from Cryptowat.ch but they were taken off during the rally at the end of May 2016 since they were lagging one hour. Use [BitcoinWisdom](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/) when you trade.

You can do exchange or margin trades and you have the standard possibility to do market or limit orders. To short Bitcoin you can use P2P lending system for margin trading on Bitfinex (read more on that further down). {% aff Bitfinex https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC %} uses the {% aff maker-taker https://www.bitfinex.com/pages/fees?refcode=5egV78YtlC %} system and has very low fees.

You cannot open buy and sell position simultaneously on the same market (for instance, to hedge a short ETHBTC position) - opposite orders get filled from one another. The way to do this hedge is to open positions on CoinBTC and CoinUSD markets. You can use any coin or fiat that you have in your trading account as a collateral to borrow any currency you need.

If you have a margin position on a market that involves USD but you want your profit in a coin, you can use the _CLAIM_ button.

* Verification: None with BTC deposits.

* Markets:
 * USD, EUR, BTC, ETH denominated
 * BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, IOT, LTC, EOS, NEO, OMG, XMR, ETC, DSH, ZEC, QTUM, BTG, EDO, ETP, SAN, SNT, DATA, GNT, YOYOW, QASH, and AVT
