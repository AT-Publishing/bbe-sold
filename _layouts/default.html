On any other crypto exchange you will need to verify your identity. Depending on how many new users are currently signing up, it can take weeks before the support rep verifies your documents.</p><p>If you do not mind waiting for verification the best places to buy crypto are:</p><ul><li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/564e7650f7cad400d90001ef">Coinbase</a> which also provides a web wallet for BTC, BCH, ETH and LTC.</li><li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://coinmate.io?referral=UVdneFZXd3hiVTVaV2s5YVlXSnNlazV4Um5ScGR3PT0">CoinMate</a> which lets you buy cryptocurrencies for EUR.</li></ul><h5>Best exchange for daytrading</h5><p>One of the most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms is Bitfinex. Even though the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack">Bitfinex exchange was hacked in 2016</a> it remained hugely popular: the trading interface is great, margin trading is available for most cryptocurrencies and there is the p2p lending option that can be profitable when you do not want to trade.</p><p>However in December 2017 Bitfinex stopped accepting new users because (as most crypto exchanges) it got overloaded and could not technically keep up with the influx of people.</p><p>Your best options for 2018 are the following trading platforms:</p><ul><li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.binance.com/?ref=15980293">Binance</a> - lists new coins regularly, has two different trading views (basic and advanced), is quite reliable  could not require berification although it limits withdrawals without.</li><li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mercatox.com/?referrer=137469">Mercatox</a> - One of the still lesser known altcoin exchanges which means it is less overloaded with users. Mercatox is also quick to list new cryptocurrencies. </li><li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/564e7650f7cad400d90001ef">GDAX</a> - You will need to verify but GDAX is the most popular trading platform in the US so you will get good deep markets.</li><li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bitmex.com/register/iYQB44">BitMEX</a> - A derivative platform for more advanced traders.</li></ul>',
