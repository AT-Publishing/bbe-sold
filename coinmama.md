## About Coinmama

Coinmama is a service that lets you buy Bitcoin and Ether with debit or credit card.

Back in the day buying Bitcoin with debit card was nearly impossible. The fees went sky high as card payments are reversible by their very nature. The nature of credit and debit cards will never change. But luckily a technology making debit card payments less susceptible to fraud has advanced.

Coinmama uses a method called Simplex.

* It is an advanced fraud analysis, meaning that if you use a prepaid card it probably will not go through. That is an often false positive with fraud detection.

* An advantage is that on your debit or credit card transaction statement the payment will be listed as a payment to Simplex. If your institution is not keen on Bitcoin, this is an advantage.

If you are looking to buy Bitcoin with a Visa or MasterCard issued by a bank, and your current IP is the of the issuing country, you are good to go.

If you have a prepaid debit card you will need to verify: Send in the usual AML/KYC papers (ID and address proof) and make a selfie with the card and ID. After that you will be able to make the payment.

If you are worried about Skrill or other services not liking Bitcoin, the transaction will be listed as payment to Simplex, which is a processor for many different services. No word about crypto.

The transaction fee is still a bit higher than usual though: just about anywhere 12%.

With Coinmama, you can also choose cash payment via Western Union or buy crypto with Perfect Money.
