* Buying gold with Bitcoin
  * [BitGold](#bitgold) - Questionable reputation, no BTC payouts.
  * [Vaultoro](#vaultoro) - BTC/GOLD exchange, probably a good option
  * [JMBullion](#jmbullion) - BTC payments but not payouts

* [Buying fiat](#bitcoin-into-fiat) - If you don't want to hold a position in Bitcoin or in any other commodity you might find it better to get fiat.

* [Bitcoin Futures](#bitcoin-futures) - If you don't want to mess with fiat you can hedge Bitcoin with low-leveraged futures.

The first thing that a trader comes up with when looking for a solution to Bitcoin volatility is diversification. That's easy, you don't have to hold Bitcoins. Stick some in altcoins that are dipping of before the rise but remember it's a blatant gamble since altcoin markets are too small to be predictable.

The second thing one naturally comes up with is probably gold or some other commodity that is (incorrectly) perceived as of a stable value. That said, gold is probably not a bad investment but be prepared you need to a/ trust a third party to keep your gold, b/ trust your gold exchange that there actually is some gold and c/ probably not being able to sell back for Bitcoin. Thus far, only [Vaultoro](#vaultoro) is real BTC/GOLD market in both directions.

If none of this looks like what you are looking for, you might want to sell [BTC for fiat](#bitcoin-into-fiat) (which with Bitcoin VCC can be _somewhat_ "reversible") or to hedge Bitcoin USD value with [futures](#boitcoin-futures).

## Buying Gold with BTC

If you are a Bitcoin trader and not only want to invest Bitcoin but will also want to make profit on that investment in Bitcoin, be careful here. Selling gold is a service like any other and while some providers will let you buy gold with Bitcoin, they might not let you sell it for Bitcoin.

The only pure Bitcoin-gold market right now, standing completely outside the banking system, is [Vaultoro](#vaultoro).

## ##BitGold

{% aff BitGold http://bitgold.com %} has a [reputation](http://www.runtogold.com/goldmoney/bitgold-review/) of a suspicious place.

There were discussions on Reddit whether BitGold is scam or not but failed to reach other point that the BitGold staff Emily who showed up on Reddit avoided answering questions she was asked:

{% amp page.image[0] page.image_alt[0] %}

It looks shady and kind of raises the question if all of the gold in third-party storage actually exists. I have not ventured into this to find out, to be honest.

BitGold requires full AML/KYC for their customers. First step is to verify your phone number which then determines the country of your address.

The important part, and the biggest disadvantage, is that while you can use Bitcoin as a fast way to deposit money, you cannot possible sell gold back to Bitcoin:

{% amp page.image[1] page.image_alt[1] %}

## ##Vaultoro

{% aff Vaultoro Gold Exchange https://www.vaultoro.com/?a=100376 %} is the only network where you only operate in gold vs. Bitcoins. They have [public audits](https://audit.vaultoro.com/) to prove their holdings, as explained on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2vrr11/after_1_year_of_really_hard_work_we_have_finally/).

What's the public audit? Well, as you register you get your public account ID. That ID (a random string) is published at audit.vaultoro.com along with your Bitcoin and gold holdings. Everyone can check their own holdings, users don't have to be logged in.

From cointelegraph.com:

_Joshua Scigala is reported to have lost a chunk of change in Mt. Gox's collapse, and he went on to found Vaultoro as a “glass books” bitcoin-gold exchange._

_The exchange uses three types of bitcoin wallets. They include “a hot wallet that is hosted online and used for daily trades, a warm wallet for auditing purpose that holds an amount of BitcoinCT r:  8 slightly above the amount in the hot wallet, and finally, mutisignature cold wallets, which hold the majority of users' funds.”_

_Vaultoro's vaults are located in Switzerland, and are audited bi-annually by BDO International. No government papers are required to purchase through Vaultoro unless the user buys more than US$5000 worth of gold per day. Services are not offered to anyone from Iran, Syria or North Korea._

Your gold is stilled _stored_ and _insured_ somewhere and redeeming it is not so easy. {% aff Vaultoro https://www.vaultoro.com/?a=100376 %} owns mass of gold so you need to pay the expense of cutting off your slice and sending it to you. The costs of this will be individual.

On {% aff Vaultoro https://www.vaultoro.com/?a=100376 %} you don't need to verify yourself, you just cannot sign up from those three forbidden countries mentioned above.

* Unverified accounts are limited to 5000 USD.
* Unverified users cannot redeem physical gold.
* Verification takes an ID and a proof of residency not older than 3 months.

{% amp page.image[4] page.image_alt[1] %}

**But finally, because {% aff Vaultoro https://www.vaultoro.com/?a=100376 %} is a bitcoin-gold exchange, you can sell gold for Bitcoin too.** You even can use Coinigy, the Bloomberg-style trading platform, to trade BTC/GOLD.

* [Coinigy](https://www.coinigy.com/pricing/) costs 15 USD a month with 30 days trial.
* For free BTC/GOLD charts head over to [CryptoCoinCharts](http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/pair/btc/gold/vaultoro).

## ##JMBullion

{% amp post {{page.image[3]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}


{% aff JMBullion http://www.jmbullion.com/ %} is a respected provider of not only gold but all precious metals. They are reputable so naturally it was good news for many traders that JMBullion started accepting Bitcoin too. However, they are no bitcoin-gold exchange like {% aff Vaultoro https://www.vaultoro.com/?a=100376 %}.

## Bitcoin into fiat

{% amp post {{page.image[2]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}

If you don't want to invest in gold or ony other commodity, you might find it better to just sel Bitcoin for cash.

**One stop shops**

If you _just_ want to pay out with no intention to use that money for trading again, you can either withdraw the money to your bank account or to PayPal. BitcoinLTD and other places are recommended in [this article](/bitcoin-to-paypal.html).

{% amp post {{page.image[5]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}

**Reversible exchange**

Wirex

If you want to get fiat but you still want to keep that backdoor of switching back to Bitcoin easily, you need Wirex card (formerly E-Coin). Their prepaid card has this option. Keep in mind the exchange rate will be different for each exchange (to and from fiat) since the market price will probably have changed.

PerfectMoney

Another option is {% aff PerfectMoney https://perfectmoney.is/?ref=7622697 %}. It is a centralized eWallet similar to PayPal or Skrill **but** payments are **not reversible**. With {% aff PerfectMoney https://perfectmoney.is/?ref=7622697 %} you cannot do chargeback.

That makes {% aff PerfectMoney https://perfectmoney.is/?ref=7622697 %} more Bitcoin-friendly as selling BTC for PM money is not as risky as for PayPal or {% aff Skrill https://account.skrill.com/signup?rid=69256549 %} money. People on LBC won't charge so much above market and generally the transfer will be a lot easier.

BTC to PerfectMoney *and back* - Your options

* {% aff Sell BTC for PM on LocalBitcoins https://localbitcoins.com/sell-bitcoins-online/perfect-money/?ch=4nq3 %}, or {% aff buy BTC for PM via LocalBitcoins https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/perfect-money/?ch=4nq3 %}.
* {% aff Via AdvCash VCC http://wallet.advcash.com/referral/3d50b494-473e-45e5-8434-5ad9d8658cc8 %}, it is one of their default transfer options (see image below).
* Exchangers like {% aff Coinomat https://coinomat.com/?utm_source=ffrf8000 %}. PM has their own list of supported partners {% aff here https://perfectmoney.is/business-partners.html/?ref=7622697 %} but scammers sometimes trade in their name on LBC or elsewhere so be careful about that.

## Bitcoin Futures

Using Bitcoin futures to hedge the Bitcoin dollar value is the most advanced way to do this. It is probably of some use for you only if you plan to accept BTC in your business or if you plan an expense in BTC in, say, three months time.

So, if you rent a VPS or two with quarterly payments, if you also pay your VPN subscription around that time or if you hire people for Bitcoin, hedging with futures could help you quite some with your finance management. At least if the price for those services is pegged to USD.

## ##The gist of hedging Bitoin dollar value:

You are expecting to get certain amount of Bitcoin on certain date and you will need to use those coins to cover other expenses as soon as you get them. The expenses are all pegged to a fiat currency.

You want them to have certain dollar value, possibly the one they would have today. That means you sell a future contract that will be mildly leveraged.

By selling the contract you open a short position and by leveraging it (say, 3x) you don't need to put in the full amount of hedged Bitcoins (since you probably don't even have them yet).

## ##The day you receive your Bitcoin comes:

* If their dollar value is higher than you needed you are fine. Your future contract is in red numbers but the profit from increased value should compensate it.

* If the dollar value of BTC is lower than you need, you use the profit from your future contract to add the rest of the dollar value you need.

As for hedging, the best platform is definitely {% aff CryptoFacilities https://www.cryptofacilities.com/derivatives/380f92bf-2de7-45e5-bc0a-28faf5f217fc %} but sadly, not available for US identities.
