## Bitcoin traders - Most known communities

**Web / Tradingview**

* **The image:** None - probably for the best.
* **The reality:** The go to place when you cannot sleep. Bromances over PM please. Good charts, mostly good people, mostly bad TA, emotions occasional but turbulent.

**Web or apps / Reddit**

* **The image:** _It's like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal_ wait no that's actually [/r/wallstreetbets](http://archive.is/hHzKE) sorry
* **The reality:** Sound information in the daily discussion, healthy skepticism, mods distinguish between community bonding offtopic posts and fluff offtopic posts. No memes, no bots. FUD occasional but strong. *Bonus: If you mention an exchange name two or three times in a comment someone from support will come over as they all have a mention monitoring API.*

**Telegram / Whaleclub**

* **The image:** _Crypto heavy but we trade the pulse of whatever is moving (BTC, Forex, Oil, SPX500, Equities)_
* **The reality:** Bunch of guys riding the ego trip.
